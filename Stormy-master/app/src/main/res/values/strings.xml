Important things to know before buying a house
1. Incentives and Impositions
In other words, taxes. Taxes can be both a helping hand and a hindrance when it comes to home ownership. Tax credits for first-time home buyers can help you get into a home (provided youre not filing a fraudulent claim), and there are several tax deductions available to home owners. There are many ways the IRS encourages home ownership, so you should know the facts about tax credits.

On the other hand, the purchase price isn\'t the only cost of a home. Owning property also means owing property taxes. Property taxes can vary significantly, depending on the value of your property and where you live. One of the biggest keys to understanding home buying and home ownership is understanding how property tax rates work.

2. Inspections
How do you know that the home of your dreams won\'t turn into a house of horrors after you buy it? Inspection. A comprehensive home inspection before you buy (including hiring the right home inspector) can save you from:

Murder homes
Snake houses
Homes laced with toxic mold
Literally haunted houses
Conducting a proper home inspection is more than just kicking the tires on a used car, so make sure you don\'t skimp on the scrutiny.

3. Institutions
Just because you bought a house doesn\'t mean you can do whatever you want on your property. There may be a few governing institutions that will limit your freedom, beginning with your homeowners association. While not every house is subject to a homeowners association, HOAs can regulate everything from pets and landscaping to pink playhouses in the backyard.

HOAs have been known to go after homeowners for grass that\'s too brown and families that are too large, so be on the lookout for house rules in HOA agreements, as well as any city, county, or state ordinances that might affect the enjoyment of your home.

4. Insurance
There are two kinds of insurance you\'re going to need when buying a home: title insurance and homeowner\'s insurance. When you buy a home, you don\'t just get the land and the house on top â€” you get title to own the property. That legal title can carry defects, like liens or easements. It\'s also possible that the seller doesn\'t have air, mineral, or utility rights to the property. In extreme cases, the seller may not own the property outright or at all.

A title search is designed to ferret out any issues with a title to property before the sale takes place. However, some issues or defects may get missed, or the extent of the issue may be misunderstood. A good title insurance policy can protect you from financial losses due to undetected errors in the title before the sale. So, if a previous owner failed to pay some taxes on a lien, you won\'t be on the hook.

Homeowner\'s insurance is a no-brainer -- you just went through this entire home buying process and spent so much money on your home, why wouldn\'t you insure it? A good homeowner\'s insurance policy can cover everything from theft and damage to injury liability. And while a basic policy may not cover every natural disaster, it may come in handy for certain holiday mishaps.
